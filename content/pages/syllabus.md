--------------------

Lectures: 2 days / week, 2-3 hours / session

Description
-----------

This graduate level course in crystal structure refinement focuses on practical aspects of crystal structure determination from data collection strategies to data reduction and basic and advanced refinement problems of organic and inorganic molecules.

Required Text
-------------

The required text is:

MÃ¼ller, P. _Crystal Structure Refinement_. 1st ed. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2006. ISBN: 9780198570769.

Grading
-------

The final grade for this course is determined by a student's performance on in-class exercises, structure problems, and the final examination.

Academic Honesty
----------------

It is expected that students will maintain the highest standards of academic honesty.

With respect to homework assignments, it is expected that no student will turn in work that is not his or her own by copying the work of another student or by using the work or solutions from this course given in previous years. Discussion of approaches to solving the homework problems after attempting to work the problems independently, however, is permitted and encouraged.

It is expected that during a test or examination, a student will not:

1.  accept or use information of any kind from other students.
2.  represent the work of another student as his or her own.
3.  use aids to memory other than those expressly permitted by the examiner.

Following a test or examination, a student will not try to deceive teachers or graders by misrepresenting or altering his or her previous work. In advance of a test or exam, a student will not knowingly obtain access to the exam questions.

Departures from the above standards are contrary to fundamental principles of MIT and of the larger scientific community. Such departures are considered serious offenses for which disciplinary penalties, including suspension and expulsion, can be imposed.
